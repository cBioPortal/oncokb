There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas harboring a RTEL1 truncating mutation.
SYT6-CSDE1	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		CSDE1, an RNA-binding protein, is mutated at low frequencies in various tumors.	It is unknown whether a truncating mutation in CSDE1 is oncogenic.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring a CSDE1 truncating mutation.
PDGFRB-PDGFRB	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		PDGFRB, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is infrequently mutated in solid tumors.	PDGFRB is considered an oncogene and truncating mutations in oncogenes are typically nonfunctional.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring a PDGFRB truncating mutation.
ATM-ATM	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE	Likely Oncogenic	ATM is a tumor suppressor involved in DNA damage repair. Germline mutations in ATM result in ataxia telangiectasia syndrome and are associated with an increased risk of developing certain cancers.	This ATM deletion is a truncating alteration and is considered likely oncogenic	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an ATM truncating mutation.
CDK8-CDK8	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		CDK8 encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in DNA transcription. Amplifications of CDK8 are found in colorectal cancers.	It is unknown whether a truncating mutation in CDK8 is oncogenic.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring a CDK8 truncating mutation.
BRCA2-CDC16	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE	Likely Oncogenic	BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage response and can be mutated in various cancer types.	This BRCA2 deletion is a truncating alteration and is considered likely oncogenic	While the PARP inhibitors olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA2-mutant ovarian cancer (olaparib only in the germline setting), their clinical utility in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring the somatic BRCA2 truncating mutation is unknown.
AR-AR	DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		AR (androgen receptor) is a transcription factor that is most frequently altered in advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer.	AR is considered an oncogene and truncating mutations in oncogenes are typically nonfunctional.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an AR truncating mutation.
