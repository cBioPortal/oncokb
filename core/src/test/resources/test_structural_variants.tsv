This BRCA2 deletion may be a truncating alteration and is considered likely oncogenic.	While the PARP inhibitors olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib are FDA-approved for the treatment of patients with BRCA2-mutant ovarian cancer (olaparib only in the germline setting), their clinical utility in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring the somatic BRCA2 truncating mutation is unknown.
AR-AR		DELETION	Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma	FALSE		AR (androgen receptor), a transcription factor, is most frequently altered in advanced or castration-resistant prostate cancer.	AR is considered an oncogene and truncating mutations in oncogenes are typically nonfunctional.	There are no FDA-approved or NCCN-compendium listed treatments specifically for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma harboring an AR truncating mutation.
EGFR	KDD	DUPLICATION	Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	FALSE	Oncogenic	EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is altered by amplification and/or mutation in lung and brain cancers among others.
