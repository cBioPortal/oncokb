Repository for OncoKB, an oncogenomics knowledgebase.

Multi-tier system for annotating and classifying mutation and copying number alteration events in cancer.

We use Google Reatime API to store all information curators generated.
We use MySQL to store data after reviewing

#Front-end
OncoKB front-end is built with lots of great open source JS libraries. AngularJS is used as framework. Bower is used to manage denpendencies. Yeoman is used to initiate project and angular-generator is used to create angular directive/service/factory etc.

##Install project
1. Install npm & bower & yo & grunt-cli (globally)
2. Go to web/yo folder
3. npm install
4. bower install

##Use website without back-end
1. Copy data-EXAMPLE to data under web/yo/app/scripts/
2. Prepare properties files  
    ```c
    cd core/src/main/resources/properties/
    cp config-EXAMPLE.properties config.properties
    cp database-EXAMPLE.properties database.properties
    cp log4j-EXAMPLE.properties log4j.properties
    ```

3. Set parameter 'dataFromFile' to true in web/yo/app/scripts/services/dataconnector.js
4. Under web/yo/, run 'grunt serve'

## Show error in console
Uncomment the $delegate
`````````
$provide.decorator('$exceptionHandler', function($delegate, $injector){
    return function(exception, cause){
        var $rootScope = $injector.get('$rootScope');
        $rootScope.addError({message: 'Exception', reason: exception, case: cause});
        //$delegate(exception, cause);
    };
});
`````````

## app.js file setting (Will be moved to front end configure file)
```
OncoKB.config = {
    clientId: 'Your client ID from google developer console',
    scopes: [
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.profile.emails.read',
        'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'
    ],
    folderId: '', //The folder ID where you put all google realtime documents
    backupFolderId: '', //The backup folder ID
    userRoles: {
        'public': 1, // 0001
        'user':   2, // 0010
        'curator':4, // 0100
        'admin':  8  // 1000
    },
    users: '', //Your user management Google Spreadsheet ID, you need to share this file to the service email address. At least, give it view permission.
    accessLevels: {}
